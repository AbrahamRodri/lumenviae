              The Rosary contemplates the mysteries of Christ's life through the eyes of Mary.
              Traditionally, the Rosary consisted of <strong>fifteen mysteries</strong>
              divided into three sets:
              the Joyful, Sorrowful, and Glorious Mysteries.

              In 2002, Pope St. John Paul II proposed the addition of five <strong>Luminous Mysteries</strong>,
              also called the Mysteries of Light, which focus on Christ's public ministry between His Baptism
              and His Passion. This brought the total to <strong>twenty mysteries</strong>.

                    And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:27</span>
                    To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

                    Who having heard, was troubled at his saying, and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.

                    And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.

                    He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:33</span>

                    And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

                    And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him up in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

                    And there were in the same country shepherds watching, and keeping the night watches over their flock.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">2:9</span>
                    And behold an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the brightness of God shone round about them; and they feared with a great fear.

                    And the angel said to them: Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, that shall be to all the people:

                    And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God, and saying:

                    Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to men of good will.

                    And it came to pass, after the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another: Let us go over to Bethlehem, and let us see this word that is come to pass, which the Lord hath shewed to us.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">2:16</span>

                    And seeing, they understood of the word that had been spoken to them concerning this child.

                    And all that heard, wondered; and at those things that were told them by the shepherds.

                    But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart.

                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">2:26</span>
                    And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.

                    And she was a widow until fourscore and four years: who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day.

                    Blessed are the clean of heart: they shall see God.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">5:9</span>
                    Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.

                    Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">5:11</span>
                    Blessed are ye when they shall revile you, and persecute you, and speak all that is evil against you, untruly, for my sake:
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">5:12</span>
                    Be glad and rejoice for your reward is very great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets that were before you.

                    Matthew 5:14-16 (Light of the World):
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">5:14</span>
                    You are the light of the world. A city seated on a mountain cannot be hid.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">5:15</span>
                    Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may shine to all that are in the house.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">5:16</span>
                    So let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

                    Matthew 6:9-13 (The Lord's Prayer):
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">6:9</span>
                    Thus therefore shall you pray: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">6:10</span>
                    Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">6:11</span>
                    Give us this day our supersubstantial bread.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">6:12</span>
                    And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">6:13</span>
                    And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen.

                    Matthew 7:7-8, 12: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">7:7</span>
                    Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">7:8</span>
                    For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">7:12</span>
                    All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. For this is the law and the prophets.

                    Luke 7:47-50: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">7:47</span>
                    Wherefore I say to thee: Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much. But to whom less is forgiven, he loveth less.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">7:48</span>
                    And he said to her: Thy sins are forgiven thee.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">7:49</span>
                    And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that forgiveth sins also?
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">7:50</span>
                    And he said to the woman: Thy faith hath made thee safe, go in peace.

                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">17:5</span>
                    And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">17:6</span>
                    And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.

                    And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them, Arise, and fear not.

                    And there appeared to them Elias with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.

                    And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:5</span>

                    And there was a cloud overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my most beloved son; hear ye him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:7</span>
                    And immediately looking about, they saw no man any more, but Jesus only with them.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:8</span>
                    And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them not to tell any man what things they had seen, till the Son of man shall be risen again from the dead.

                    And it came to pass about eight days after these words, that he took Peter, and James, and John, and went up into a mountain to pray.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:29</span>
                    And whilst he prayed, the shape of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and glittering.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:30</span>
                    And behold two men were talking with him. And they were Moses and Elias,
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:31</span>
                    Appearing in majesty. And they spoke of his decease that he should accomplish in Jerusalem.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:32</span>
                    But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep. And waking, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:33</span>
                    And it came to pass, that as they were departing from him, Peter saith to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias; not knowing what he said.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:34</span>
                    And as he spoke these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them; and they were afraid, when they entered into the cloud.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">9:35</span>
                    And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son; hear him.

                    And whilst the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of these things which they had seen.

                    Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani. And he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">26:37</span>
                    And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">26:38</span>
                    Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death. Stay you here and watch with me.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">26:39</span>
                    And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">26:40</span>
                    And he cometh to his disciples and findeth them asleep. And he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">26:41</span>
                    Watch ye: and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">26:42</span>
                    Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">26:43</span>
                    And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.

                    And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.

                    Then he cometh to his disciples and said to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest. Behold the hour is at hand: and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">26:46</span>
                    Rise: let us go. Behold he is at hand that will betray me.

                    Mark 14:32-42: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:32</span>
                    And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:33</span>
                    And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:34</span>
                    And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:35</span>
                    And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:36</span>
                    And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:37</span>
                    And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour?
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:38</span>
                    Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:39</span>
                    A going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:40</span>
                    And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:41</span>
                    And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">14:42</span>
                    Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.

                    Luke 22:39-46: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">22:39</span>
                    And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">22:40</span>
                    And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">22:41</span>
                    And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast. And kneeling down, he prayed.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">22:42</span>
                    Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">22:43</span>
                    And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">22:44</span>
                    And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">22:45</span>
                    And when he rose up from prayer and was come to the disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">22:46</span>
                    And he said to them: Why sleep you? Arise: pray: lest you enter into temptation.

                    Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am the King of the Jews.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:22</span>
                    Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:23</span>
                    The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took his garments, (and they made four parts, to every soldier a part,) and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:24</span>
                    They said then one to another: Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they have cast lot. And the soldiers indeed did these things.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:25</span>
                    Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:26</span>
                    When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:27</span>
                    After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:28</span>
                    Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:29</span>
                    Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar and hyssop, put it to his mouth.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:30</span>
                    Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the ghost.

                    Matthew 27:33-54: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:33</span>
                    And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:34</span>
                    And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:35</span>
                    And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:36</span>
                    And they sat and watched him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:37</span>
                    And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:38</span>
                    Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand and one on the left.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:39</span>
                    And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:40</span>
                    And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:41</span>
                    In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking said:
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:42</span>
                    He saved others: himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross: and we will believe him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:43</span>
                    He trusted in God: let him now deliver him if he will have him. For he said: I am the Son of God.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:44</span>
                    And the selfsame thing the thieves also that were crucified with him reproached him with.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:45</span>
                    Now from the sixth hour, there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:46</span>
                    And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? That is, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:47</span>
                    And some that stood there and heard said: This man calleth Elias.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:48</span>
                    And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:49</span>
                    And the others said: Let be. Let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:50</span>
                    And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:51</span>
                    And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom: and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:52</span>
                    And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:53</span>
                    And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city and appeared to many.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:54</span>
                    Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.

                    And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:2</span>
                    And behold there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and coming rolled back the stone and sat upon it.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:3</span>
                    And his countenance was as lightning and his raiment as snow.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:4</span>
                    And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror and became as dead men.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:5</span>
                    And the angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:6</span>
                    He is not here. For he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:7</span>
                    And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen. And behold he will go before you into Galilee. There you shall see him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:8</span>
                    And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:9</span>
                    And behold, Jesus met them, saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet and adored him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:10</span>
                    Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee. There they shall see me.

                    Mark 16:1-14: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:1</span>
                    AND when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:2</span>
                    And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:3</span>
                    And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:4</span>
                    And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:5</span>
                    And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:6</span>
                    Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:7</span>
                    But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:8</span>
                    But they going out, fled from the sepulchre. For a trembling and fear had seized them: and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:9</span>
                    But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:10</span>
                    She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:11</span>
                    And they hearing that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:12</span>
                    And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:13</span>
                    And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:14</span>
                    At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.

                    Luke 24:1-12: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:1</span>
                    And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:2</span>
                    And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:3</span>
                    And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:4</span>
                    And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:5</span>
                    And as they were afraid and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:6</span>
                    He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was yet in Galilee,
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:7</span>
                    Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:8</span>
                    And they remembered his words.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:9</span>
                    And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:10</span>
                    And it was Mary Magdalen and Joanna and Mary of James and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:11</span>
                    And these words seemed to them as idle tales: and they did not believe them.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:12</span>
                    But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre and, stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves: and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

                    John 20:1-29: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:1</span>
                    AND on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:2</span>
                    She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:3</span>
                    Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and they came to the sepulchre.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:4</span>
                    And they both ran together, and that other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:5</span>
                    And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying; but yet he went not in.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:6</span>
                    Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying,
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:7</span>
                    And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:8</span>
                    Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to the sepulchre: and he saw, and believed.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:9</span>
                    For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:10</span>
                    The disciples therefore departed again to their home.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:11</span>
                    But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:12</span>
                    And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:13</span>
                    They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where they have laid him.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:14</span>
                    When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus.

                    Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, thinking it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:16</span>
                    Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master).
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:17</span>
                    Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your God.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:18</span>
                    Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples: I have seen the Lord, and these things he said to me.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:19</span>
                    Now when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:20</span>
                    And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:21</span>
                    He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:22</span>
                    When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:23</span>
                    Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:24</span>
                    Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:25</span>
                    The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:26</span>
                    And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:27</span>
                    Then he said to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and see my hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:28</span>
                    Thomas answered, and said to him: My Lord, and my God.
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:29</span>
                    Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed.
