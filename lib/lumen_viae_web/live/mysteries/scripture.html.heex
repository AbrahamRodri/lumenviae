              The Rosary contemplates the mysteries of Christ's life through the eyes of Mary.
              Traditionally, the Rosary consisted of <strong>fifteen mysteries</strong>
              divided into three sets:
              the Joyful, Sorrowful, and Glorious Mysteries.

              In 2002, Pope St. John Paul II proposed the addition of five <strong>Luminous Mysteries</strong>,
              also called the Mysteries of Light, which focus on Christ's public ministry between His Baptism
              and His Passion. This brought the total to <strong>twenty mysteries</strong>.

When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child, of the Holy Ghost. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:19</span> Whereupon Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was minded to put her away privately. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:20</span> But while he thought on these things, behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:21</span> And she shall bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name JESUS. For he shall save his people from their sins. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:22</span> Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:23</span> Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:24</span> And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took unto him his wife. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">1:25</span> And he knew her not till she brought forth her first born son: and he called his name JESUS.

                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:33</span> And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there: and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:34</span> And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:35</span> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others: let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:36</span> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:37</span> And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:38</span> And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:39</span> And one of those robbers who were hanged blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:40</span> But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing; thou art under the same condemnation? <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:41</span> And we indeed justly: for we receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man hath done no evil. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:42</span> And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:43</span> And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee: This day thou shalt be with me in paradise. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:44</span> And it was almost the sixth hour: and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:45</span> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:46</span> And Jesus crying with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:47</span> Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:48</span> And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">23:49</span> And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.<br /><br />
                    <strong class="underline">John 19:18-37</strong><br />
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:18</span> Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on each side, and Jesus in the midst. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:19</span> And Pilate wrote a title also, and he put it upon the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:20</span> This title therefore many of the Jews did read: because the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:21</span> Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am the King of the Jews. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:22</span> Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:23</span> The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took his garments, (and they made four parts, to every soldier a part,) and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:24</span> They said then one to another: Let us not cut it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture they have cast lot. And the soldiers indeed did these things. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:25</span> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:26</span> When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:27</span> After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:28</span> Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I thirst. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:29</span> Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar. And they, putting a sponge full of vinegar and hyssop, put it to his mouth. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:30</span> Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the ghost. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:31</span> Then the Jews (because it was the parasceve), that the bodies might not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that was a great sabbath day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:32</span> The soldiers therefore came: and they broke the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:33</span> But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:34</span> But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side, and immediately there came out blood and water. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:35</span> And he that saw it hath given testimony, and his testimony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true, that you also may believe. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:36</span> For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">19:37</span> And again another scripture saith: They shall look on him whom they pierced.<br /><br />
                    <strong class="underline">Mark 15:22-39</strong><br />
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:22</span> And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:23</span> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:24</span> And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:25</span> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:26</span> And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:27</span> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:28</span> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:29</span> And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:30</span> Save thyself, coming down from the cross. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:31</span> In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:32</span> Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, reviled him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:33</span> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:34</span> And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted: My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me? <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:35</span> And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:36</span> And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:37</span> And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:38</span> And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">15:39</span> And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the Son of God.<br /><br />
                    <strong class="underline">Matthew 27:33-54</strong><br />
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:33</span> And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:34</span> And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:35</span> And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:36</span> And they sat and watched him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:37</span> And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:38</span> Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand and one on the left. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:39</span> And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:40</span> And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:41</span> In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking said: <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:42</span> He saved others: himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross: and we will believe him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:43</span> He trusted in God: let him now deliver him if he will have him. For he said: I am the Son of God. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:44</span> And the selfsame thing the thieves also that were crucified with him reproached him with. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:45</span> Now from the sixth hour, there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:46</span> And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? That is, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me? <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:47</span> And some that stood there and heard said: This man calleth Elias. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:48</span> And immediately one of them running took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:49</span> And the others said: Let be. Let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:50</span> And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:51</span> And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom: and the earth quaked and the rocks were rent. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:52</span> And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose, <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:53</span> And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city and appeared to many. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">27:54</span> Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.

For he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">28:7</span> And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen.

For it was very great. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:5</span> And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:6</span> Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:7</span> But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">16:8</span> But they going out, fled from the sepulchre.

Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was yet in Galilee, <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:7</span> Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:8</span> And they remembered his words. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:9</span> And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:10</span> And it was Mary Magdalen and Joanna and Mary of James and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:11</span> And these words seemed to them as idle tales: and they did not believe them. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">24:12</span> But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre and, stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves: and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.<br /><br />
                    <strong class="underline">John 20:1-29</strong><br />
                    <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:1</span> AND on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen cometh early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:2</span> She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them: They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:3</span> Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and they came to the sepulchre. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:4</span> And they both ran together, and that other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:5</span> And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying; but yet he went not in. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:6</span> Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying, <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:7</span> And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one place. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:8</span> Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to the sepulchre: and he saw, and believed. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:9</span> For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:10</span> The disciples therefore departed again to their home. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:11</span> But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:12</span> And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:13</span> They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where they have laid him. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:14</span> When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:15</span> Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, thinking it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:16</span> Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning, saith to him: Rabboni (which is to say, Master). <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:17</span> Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me, for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your God. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:18</span> Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples: I have seen the Lord, and these things he said to me. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:19</span> Now when it was late that same day, the first of the week, and the doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered together, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them: Peace be to you. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:20</span> And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:21</span> He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the Father hath sent me, I also send you. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:22</span> When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:23</span> Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:24</span> Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:25</span> The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:26</span> And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace be to you. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:27</span> Then he said to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and see my hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it into my side; and be not faithless, but believing. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:28</span> Thomas answered, and said to him: My Lord, and my God. <span class="text-gold font-semibold">20:29</span> Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and have believed.
