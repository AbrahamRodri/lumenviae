The Annunciation,,"In the Annunciation, the birth of the Son of God was announced to the Blessed Virgin Mary. She was told by the Archangel Gabriel that she would conceive and bring forth a son. This mystery invites us to reflect on Mary's profound humility and her perfect submission to God's will. When we pray this mystery, we ask for the grace to say yes to God's will in our own lives, just as Mary did.",Bishop Fulton J. Sheen,The Fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary,joyful_1_annunciation.mp3
The Visitation,,"The first miracle worked by our Lord was a miracle of charity. Before He would give eyes to the blind, and speech to the dumb, and activity to the lame, and hearing to the deaf, He would give the first fruits of His Divine Life to one who was already holy: John the Baptist. This mystery teaches us that the first effects of Divine Grace should be an increase of charity and love for our neighbor.",Bishop Fulton J.

If the modern world knew the secret of happiness, it would know that love and sacrifice are inseparable.",Bishop Fulton J. Sheen,The Fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary,joyful_3_nativity.mp3
